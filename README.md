# Learning AI – From Fundamentals to Agentic Systems

This repo is my personal journey of learning AI.  
I’m starting from the basics and moving toward building agentic systems.  

The goal isn’t to be perfect — it’s to show progress, mistakes, and what I learn along the way.

### 🏷️ Tech Stack (what I plan to use)
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Hugging Face (datasets & transformers)  
- OpenAI API

## 📚 Roadmap (planned)

**Step 1 — Foundations (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)**  
- Hello World ML (predict something simple)  
- Data cleaning & EDA  
- Regression/Classification  

**Step 2 — Neural Networks (PyTorch/TensorFlow)**  
- Perceptron gates  
- MNIST classifier  
- Small CNN on CIFAR-10  

**Step 3 — LLMs & RAG**  
- Prompt basics  
- Vector search (FAISS/Chroma)  
- RAG chatbot  

**Step 4 — Agentic AI**  
- Task-runner agent  
- Multi-tool agent  
- Bug bounty POC agent

## 📝 Notes
Each project will have its own folder with:
- a small README (goal, steps, what I learned)  
- code or notebooks  
- results if I have them

## 🚀 How to Run (for later)
I’ll update this once I have the first project running.
